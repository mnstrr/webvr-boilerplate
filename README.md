# webvr-boilerplate

> Boilerplate for your WebVR experiences.

This boilerplate is based on [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and uses the  [WebVR API](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API) to provide you with all the tools needed to create immersive VR-experiences for the Web. The setup uses Grunt as Taskrunner to build your Project and watch for changes in your code.
